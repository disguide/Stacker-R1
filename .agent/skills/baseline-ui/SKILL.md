# Baseline UI

Enforces an opinionated UI baseline to prevent AI-generated interface slop.

## How to use

- `/baseline-ui`
  Apply these constraints to any UI work in this conversation.

- `/baseline-ui <file>`
  Review the file against all constraints below and output:
  - violations (quote the exact line/snippet)
  - why it matters (1 short sentence)
  - a concrete fix (code-level suggestion)

## Stack

- MUST use NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native) for all styling.
- MUST use `react-native-reanimated` for all animations.
- MUST use `expo-haptics` for tactile feedback on interactions.

## Animation

- NEVER add animation unless it is explicitly requested.
- MUST keep all animations on the UI thread (use `useAnimatedStyle`).
- NEVER animate layout properties like `width`, `height`, or `padding` (use `transform: [{ scale: ... }]` instead).
- SHOULD use "Spring" configurations (e.g., `withSpring`) for natural motion.
- NEVER exceed `200ms` for interaction feedback.
- MUST respect `AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled()`.


## Typography

- MUST use `text-balance` for headings and `text-pretty` for body/paragraphs
- MUST use `tabular-nums` for data
- SHOULD use `truncate` or `line-clamp` for dense UI
- NEVER modify `letter-spacing` (`tracking-*`) unless explicitly requested

## Layout

- MUST use a fixed `z-index` scale (no arbitrary `z-*`)
- SHOULD use `size-*` for square elements instead of `w-*` + `h-*`

## Performance

- NEVER apply `will-change` outside an active animation
- NEVER use `useEffect` for anything that can be expressed as render logic

## Design

- NEVER use gradients unless explicitly requested
- NEVER use purple or multicolor gradients
- NEVER use glow effects as primary affordances
- SHOULD use Tailwind CSS default shadow scale unless explicitly requested
- MUST give empty states one clear next action
- SHOULD limit accent color usage to one per view
- SHOULD use existing theme or Tailwind CSS color tokens before introducing new ones
